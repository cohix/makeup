# 💅🏽 Makeup

> A local development tool to replace Docker Compose, based on Make.

Makeup uses Makefiles to create a faster development workflow for microservices (when compared to Docker and docker-compose). It uses locally installed tools and a version-checking mechanism to get reasonably repeatable builds, and configures + runs things (like multiple microservices) in parallel, a la docker-compose.

The `makeup` command builds all of the components of your application and runs them together without needing containers.

To use `makeup`, you'll create: 
- The `main.mk` file (which includes tool version checks).
- Individual component `.mk` files (with `build`, `run`, `test`, `env`, and `clean` targets).
- Optional autogenerated `Makefile`, which allows anyone who isn't using `makeup` to build and run your project just as easily (by running `make up`).

The `makeup` tool is required to get started (and to get the best experience), but not required for anyone else to use your project (which might be the best part).

### Commands

Implemented:
- `makeup`: builds each component sequentially, and then runs your entire project
- `makeup test` : tests each component sequentially
- `makeup clean` : cleans each of the components in the project

In progress:
- `makeup generate` : generates the main `Makefile` for anyone to use.

Here's an example (from this repo!):

That's it for now.
